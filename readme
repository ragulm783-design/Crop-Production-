# 🌾 Crop Production Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Crop Production Dashboard** built to analyze and visualize agricultural data such as crop yield, rainfall, fertilizer usage, and production trends across different states. The dashboard helps stakeholders, policymakers, and farmers to make data-driven decisions for better crop management and resource allocation.

It integrates multiple datasets including crops, states, rainfall, and fertilizers to provide a **comprehensive view of agricultural performance**.

## ✨ Features

* 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** – Displays production trends, rainfall data, fertilizer usage, and crop distribution.
* 🌍 **State-Wise Analysis** – Compare crop performance across multiple states.
* 🌧️ **Rainfall Impact** – Visualize average rainfall vs. crop production.
* 🧪 **Fertilizer Insights** – Identify the most used fertilizers and their impact.
* 📈 **Performance Recommendations** – Strategic insights to prioritize high-performing or underperforming regions.
